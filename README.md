## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the examples, you need to have Python installed along with the respective libraries for TensorFlow and PyTorch.

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- PyTorch 1.x

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tensor-examples.git
   cd tensor-examples

Install TensorFlow:

```sh
pip install tensorflow

Install PyTorch:

```sh
pip install torch


Running the Examples
Each folder contains Python scripts that demonstrate various tensor operations. You can run each example independently.

TensorFlow Examples
Navigate to the tensorflow directory and run the desired example:

```sh
cd tensorflow
python tensor_operations.py


PyTorch Examples
Navigate to the pytorch directory and run the desired example:

```sh
cd pytorch
python tensor_operations.py
